Brief description of modules and their functions:

dislpay.cpp
-----------
This module is used to comunicate with lcd display on hardware level. It holds static array "screen"
that represents the pixels drawn on screen. The screen is drawn on lcd using display_lcd() function.
Functions:

	void init_lcd()
		Initialize the display, set parlcd_mem_base and fill static array with random color.
		
	void fill_pixel_lcd(int pos_x, int pos_y, unsigned short color)
		Colors pixel in screen on coordinates x, y with color in 565 format.

	void fill_square_lcd(int col, int row, unsigned short color)
		Colors square in screen array starting on coordinates col, row with sides equal to size 
		specified in snake-options.hpp with color in 565 format. This functions is very useful when
		creating grids and manipulating individual cells of the snake.

	void flood_fill_lcd(unsigned short color)
		Function to fill the entire screen with one color in 565 format.

	void display_lcd()
		Display the pixels stored in screen array to the physical lcd located on the MZ_APO computer.
		The pixels can be only accessed only in sequence, thus the entire screen has to always be
		filled.

	void draw_board(int *board, int board_w, int board_h, int cell_s)
		Function to fill *board array with checkerboard pattern. This array is for testing purpouses.
		
	void color_square(int col, int row, unsigned short color, unsigned short *window)
		Colors one square in the window passed to the function.

	void draw_window(const unsigned short *window)
		Draws window to physical lcd screen from external frame buffer.
